Hi, welcome to our new blog.

As you might have noticed, a number of things have happened during the last few months: a new website, new office space in downtown Bergamo and, above all, a renewed focus on what Orobix is and where it wants to go.

The last five years have been an amazing experience for us. We've taken up one challenging project after another and with every project we've challenged ourselves to exploring new methods and new technologies, even when this implied having a lot of learning to do. This approach definitely paid off - and was a ton of fun.

Starting from our roots in image analysis and numerical modeling, we entered the realms of machine learning, we built complex distributed systems and became better developers in the process. We now recognize that machine learning is going to revolutionize every aspect of the world we're leaving in. We want to be a part of this process.

So, stay tuned and watch this space. We are going to share regular updates on what we're up to.

Don't forget to [contact us](mailto:info@orobix.com) for any inquiries or check out [our website](http://www.orobix.com) to learn more about us.
