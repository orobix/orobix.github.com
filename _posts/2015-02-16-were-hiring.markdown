# We're hiring!

As part of the [REVAMMAD project](http://revammad.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk) (REtinal Vascular Modelling, Measurement and Diagnosis), we're looking for an Early Stage Researcher to join us full time at Orobix. The ideal candidate has good coding skills, a background in machine learning and an interest in contributing to the retinal imaging field from within a dynamic environment.

More details [here](http://ec.europa.eu/euraxess/index.cfm/jobs/jobDetails/33985591). Note that there are some formal requirements to be fulfilled (less than 4 year research experience, no doctoral degree, no residence in Italy for longer than 12 months in the past 3 years).

By the way, our team is expanding. Beside the position advertised above, we are currently looking for machine learning expertise, so please consider sending your CV to info@orobix.com.

It's our goal to keep building a healthy, diverse work environment. As such, it is particularly important for us to make sure we're receiving applications from all gender and ethnic groups. 

We are looking forward to hearing from you.
