        <p class="branch-description">Our methodological approach allows us to operate in disparate contexts, from automated image
          analysis for pharmaceutical applications to numerical simulations of medical devices, from machine learning applied to industrial
          manufacturing to distributed architectures for real-time trading. Whatever the application, we commit to own the problem we're working on,
          bringing fresh views and added value to the table, reaching measurable results in timely and cost-effective steps. At Orobix we value
          the process that leads to a solution as much as the solution itself.
