In the context of the <a href="http://www.vph-arch.eu" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">ARCH</a> project, <a href="http://archtk.github.com" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">pyNS</a>, a flexible open&ndash;source 0D &frasl; 1D solver written in Python has been developed and it is currently used for patient-specific simulation of vascular access for hemodialysis. In order to aid its adoption by researchers and tech-savy clinicians for vascular access applications and beyond, Orobix has developed the open-source <a href="http://archtk.github.com" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">archTk</a> <span class="caps">GUI</span> application, <span class="caps">ARCH</span> Network Editor.</p></li>

However, quantitative velocity assessments are hampered by noise, artifacts and challenges in image segmentation. A tool for streamlining the analysis of PC&ndash;MR images and the required user image interaction has been developed at Orobix laboratories.</p></li>

To be seamlessly integrated in surgical workflows, images have to be processed to meet the surgeon&prime;s needs, which implies performing registration, segmentation and visualization. <b>Orobix Workflow Manager</b> is a web&ndash;based tool interfaced with <a href="http://www.slicer.org" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">3DSlicer</a> and local clusters or the cloud, which empowers surgeons with the capability of retrieving images from a <span class="caps">PACS</span>, requesting visualizations, annotating processed images and making them available for surgery.</p></li>

The application allows streamlined analysis of Magnetic Resonance Angiography data and it takes advantage of <a href="projects.html" style="text-decoration:underline">Bunjee</a> to expressively visualize results in 3D, navigate through cases and scenes, compare between cases and deal with large amounts of quantitative geometric data.</p></li>

The prototype provides an integrated solution for image segmentation, morphological analysis and hemodynamic simulation of vascular segments. It adopts <a href="projects.html" style="text-decoration:underline">Bunjee</a> to allow flexible visualization, fast case navigation and intuitive 3D user interaction, and it is interfaced with the cloud for computation intensive tasks.</p></li>

The system is targeted at those settings in which large institutional clinical record systems are too stiff to meet particular departmental needs, or at institutions looking for small and agile solutions that can grow in time. Users have access to the system through web-browsers, dedicated applications or portable devices, throughout the hospital network.</p></li>

Data collection can be fully configured through the definition of a set of <span class="caps">XML</span> files for each case report form and distributed and maintained from a central server throughout the installed clients. During collection, data are centrally synchronized in a secure way with the server. All communication happens through the web and the system retains full offline operation.</p></li>

The final tool is aimed at neurosurgeons and the interface is straightforward and clutter&ndash;free. The connection of the workflow to an high&ndash;performance computing cluster completes the project, providing image segmentation and registration results in minutes.</p></li>

The key in evaluating the efficacy of treatment is the availability of a sensitive, early marker of disease progression, and image&ndash;based markers seem to have such characteristics. A system based on novel and intuitive interaction paradigms is currently being developed, permitting a fast quantification of the volume of <span class="caps">ADPKD</span> kidneys and their components.</p></li>
