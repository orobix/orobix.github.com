      <h4 class="branch-name">Privacy Policy</h4>
      <img class="img-responsive" src="img/06_team/separator.gif">

      <p class="branch-description">

          Personal information encompasses individual details about personal or business relations of a specific or specifiable natural person (affected party), e.g. your own personal information such as name, address, telephone number, and date of birth.
          </br>
          In principle, you can visit our web pages without informing us who you are. When our pages are viewed we automatically register your IP address or the domain name of the user as well as which pages are viewed. We use this information to statistically evaluate the usage of our site by our visitors and to continuously improve our web pages using the gained insights. For this reason we are using the Google Analytics software. In this process you will remain anonymous as individual user.

          </br>
          In some areas of our web sites we request personal data from you to help us identify you as a person. Normally this will involve so-called inventory data, i.e. such personal information of a user required for the justification, design of content, or change of a contractual relationship in regards to our service. Such inventory data are collected for example when you create a user account and/or register Orobix products.
          </br>
          We process these inventory data in such a fashion that the highest possible privacy of your personal data is safeguarded. Using authentication and authorization procedures, we ensure as much as possible that unauthorized individuals have no access to your personal data or use services that are exclusive to you.We will only contact you in an unsolicited way by means of the personal information stored on our servers if you have given your explicit consent to do so.

          </br>
          In as far as you are asked to enter personal information (e.g. email addresses, names, addresses) on one of our web pages, the submission of these data (Submit) is strictly on a voluntary basis. In these cases, we ask your explicit consent whilst stating the purpose of use. We do not collect, process, or use this data for other purposes without your express consent.
          At any time you can revoke your consent which will become effective in the future.
