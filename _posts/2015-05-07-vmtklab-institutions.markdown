We recently offered to a number of universities and research institutes around the world to try for free and for 1 year [VMTKLab](http://vmtklab.orobix.com), our application for image-based modeling of the cardiovascular system.

Today we're happy to announce that [30 institutions](http://vmtklab.orobix.com/#users) from USA, Canada, Europe, China, Japan and Brazil have adopted VMTKLab for their research.

We have several additional modules in the work, such as the volume meshing module and the cfd on the cloud module powered by [Rescale](http://www.rescale.com) - take a look at the [VMTKLab website](http://vmtklab.orobix.com/#news) for an overview. We'll roll them out during the next few weeks.
We'll be silver sponsor of the next [Congress of the European Society of Biomechanics in Prague, July 5-8](http://www.esbiomech2015.org/), don't miss it!
